# Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset

## Introduction

This project applies a Linear Regression model to the California Housing dataset to predict median house values based on various features such as location, demographics, and housing attributes. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and provides insights into housing trends in California.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing, including feature scaling and handling missing values.
- Implementation of Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`.
- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `longitude`: Geographic coordinate (east-west).
- `latitude`: Geographic coordinate (north-south).
- `housing_median_age`: Median age of houses in the area.
- `total_rooms`: Total number of rooms in the area.
- `total_bedrooms`: Total number of bedrooms in the area.
- `population`: Population of the area.
- `households`: Number of households in the area.
- `median_income`: Median income of the area.
- `median_house_value`: Median house value (target variable).
- `ocean_proximity`: Proximity to the ocean.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eder-gummies/Notebooks/CaliforniaHousingLinearRegression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CaliforniaHousingLinearRegression
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) and place it in the `Data/Raw/` directory.

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LinearRegression_CaliforniaHousing.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

Key results from the analysis include:

- A trained Linear Regression model capable of predicting median house values.
- Visualizations to explore the relationships between features and the target variable.
- Model evaluation metrics indicating the performance of the regression analysis.
